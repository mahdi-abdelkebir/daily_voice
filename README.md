# daily_voice

First time using React Native. It was a bit overwhelming especially the differences between functional and class components, different ways of implementing things, the amazing hooks...

Dead tired. This was actually made in 7 days for a competition, imagine that, and I never used React Native before.

It's basically a voice assistant. Well, let's say it's an API voice assistant. You say a specific phrase and then it'll communicate with some specific API depending on this phrase, then returns a formatted voice message. 

The voice assistant was created using DialogFlow. Though, I didn't dwelve too much into that, simply because I don't have the time to learn it. I just used it for casual dialogue admittedly.

I also used too much time going on about basic things, and only implemented Astrology Sign, Netflix top movies and series, and lastly a Youtube Trending API. You can also see Spotify UI lying around. 

These APIs were implemented thanks to RapidAPIs.

I really want to expand this project more, it's actually really interesting. I especially discovered that there's a music agent in DialogFlow, too late sadly. I also had ideas about the Weather API. Well anyway.

Here are a few pictures:
